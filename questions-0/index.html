        <h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>3 days after drastic cut-down on cigarettes smoked I got severe depression,
after 2 very hard days I lit up cigarette with modified filter tip what immediately
(first puff) lifted me up out of depression, then I confirmed this effect next day(s).</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>33yo male smoking 30+/day strong roll-ups for 15+ years spontaneously decided to limit daily intake of smokes to 5/day.
Last tried to quit a year after started smoking.
No history of depression.
The goal was to lit up filtered, medium strength, commercial cigarette no more than every 4 hours.</p>

<h2 id="smoking">Smoking</h2>
<p>Till the reduction day I smoked using very strong, frequent, deep inhales.
I was chasing fast and strong sensation, usually ending my cigarette before others were in the middle of theirs.</p>

<h2 id="process-of-reduction">Process of reduction</h2>
<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>

<p>It wasn’t as hard as I expected, I was quite excited that it’s possible to smoke
 in so big intervals and feel &amp; function acceptably, I felt pains in chest,
 wanted to inhale anything that make fumes.</p>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>

<p>Woke up early, felt energetic/searching/boosted, was lacking of concentration,
strong cravings but nothing crazy. I yawned every half hour at least (beside feeling quite fresh/awake).
Strange feeling that I’ll call from now <strong><em>lagging eyes</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>

<p>Satisfied of holding my goal so far. Cigarettes smoked by schedule almost stopped
to give anything beside limiting cravings. Almost none concentration, yawning. Started feeling
fatigue.</p>

<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>

<p>Extremely fatigue, anxiety, exasperation, aggression. No satisfaction from scheduled smokes,
no desire to smoke more, no plan, minds in fog, totally lost and down, never felt in such way before.</p>

<h3 id="day-5">Day 5</h3>

<p>When woken up I felt better than day before but after first 2 scheduled smokes I knew that I’m
on same, or even worse, course that yesterday. At 3rd cigarette, out of desperation, I did what I used to do
when got light cigarette or wanted special boost - I bite of part of filtering material.
At first puff I got <strong><em>WOW</em></strong> effect, immediately (as I remember, it occurred even before I exhaled this first smoke), it was euphoric.
Whole „darkness” from past days started to fade out, after second, third puff I’ve got sharp mind, fatigue went away. Rest of this cigarette I spent cheering and asking myself what has happened. Rest of schedule unmodified.</p>

<h3 id="day-6">Day 6</h3>

<p>First cig of a day was ok, an hour before second cig I started to get <em>lagging eyes</em> and yawning, decided to take last 2 puffs of 2nd cig with filtering material removed, symptoms disappeared, situation repeated around 3rd cig.</p>

<h3 id="next-3-weeks">Next 3 weeks</h3>

<p>I smoked by schedule, modifying filter for last puffs for most of times, light symptoms (<em>lagging eyes</em>, yawning) never occurred.
Acceptable concentration but i.e. had to change my glasses to a bit stronger.
I found it to be very hard keep my smoking regimen in longer run, cravings didn’t ease with time, a lot/too much self-control required.
About month after reduction I tired nasal snuff and it was bulls eye, I quit smoking in 2 days following.</p>

<h3 id="next-3-months">Next 3 months</h3>

<p>I mostly snuff, occasionally smoke cigarette without inhaling, some pipe (no inhalation also) and vaping (mouth to nose). Concentration is very good, I can easily use my old glasses, far from depression.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>

<p>My first thought at day 5 was: <em>”there has to be strong psychoactive substance other than nicotine in cigarette smoke that is delivered in much higher amounts when filter is modified/removed”</em>.</p>

<p>I tired to make a graphical representation of how I understand this situation showing demonstrative plasma nicotine levels and some <strong><em>X</em></strong> levels:</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/assets/images/spline2-b.png" alt="nicotine and X chart" />
  
    <figcaption><a href="/assets/images/spline2-b.png">plasma nicotine and X levels</a>
</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<h3 id="notes-regarding-the-chart">Notes regarding the chart</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 days preceding reduction shows 20cig/day 6AM-10PM habit</li>
  <li>nicotine increase by single cigarette is set to 10ng/ml, half life is 2 hours</li>
  <li>ratio of <em>X</em> intake using modified filter vs standard filter is set to 10:1, half life is 48h</li>
  <li>the green <em>“X threshold”</em> line shows X level below which my symptoms kicked in</li>
  <li>nicotine chart doesn’t include increased nicotine delivery through modified filter (up to 2x), omitted for clarity <small>#TODO ref here</small></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if there are two strong psychoactive substances in smoke users should be informed</li>
  <li>when they have different kinetics it might make smoking addiction more complex (it’s complex even without it)</li>
  <li>you might not get out of depressive/withdrawal state using single filtered cigarette, you might have to intake a pack to feel difference (pattern often reported by quitters) and by doing so - you’re again into smoking</li>
  <li>maybe I could i.e. chew my used filter buds to get rid of symptoms? :)</li>
  <li>…</li>
  <li>it’s interesting?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>what is <em>X</em>?</li>
  <li>does higher drag from filter modification matters?</li>
  <li>maybe it isn’t <em>X</em>, maybe filter tuning leads to higher nicotine absorption rate (alkalization?) so tuned smoke pierced through my nicotine tolerance and lifted my depression?</li>
  <li>am I vulnerable to depression or it was reducing/quitting result only?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>

<h3 id="lagging-eyes"><em>Lagging eyes</em></h3>

<p>Eyes don’t catch up with fast head movements, they need more time to catch focus.
Moreover I felt extra weight on top of the head but only when moving my head, so
it was like extra inertia.
All this also when rested, physically fresh.
It was like brain falling asleep while rest of the body is going opposite.</p>

<h3 id="yawning">Yawning</h3>

<p>Every 15-60 minutes tension on facial muscles, especially around eyes, sometimes with a tear or two. What’s different between standard yawning that it didn’t actually lead to opening mouths to take breath in.
Also happened when I felt rested overall.</p>

<h3 id="filter-tuning">Filter tuning</h3>

<p>Pull-out filtering material using front teeth, bite off or chip away tiny portion of material fibers,
place the rest of material into filter tube using rotary movements.</p>

<p>It takes about 3 seconds when practiced.</p>

<p>For the sake of science ;) I smoked whole cigarette with tuned filter first time in 4 months, felt nothing special (I intake quite a lot of snuff daily tho).</p>
